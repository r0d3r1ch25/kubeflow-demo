# UI Connectivity Issue Resolution

## Issue
UI shows error: `[HPM] Error occurred while trying to proxy request /apis/v2beta1/pipelines from UI to http://ml-pipeline:8888 (ECONNREFUSED)`

## Root Cause Analysis
- API server is running and responding correctly
- Service configuration is correct
- DNS resolution works
- Issue appears to be timing-related during startup

## Solutions Applied
1. **Added readiness probe to UI** - Ensures UI waits before making requests
2. **Verified API server configuration** - Ports and service are correct
3. **Confirmed connectivity** - Direct API calls work via port-forward

## Current Status
- ✅ API server responds to health checks
- ✅ API server handles v2beta1 requests correctly  
- ✅ Service and DNS resolution working
- ⚠️ UI connectivity intermittent during startup

## Verification Steps
```bash
# Test API server directly
kubectl port-forward -n kubeflow svc/ml-pipeline 8888:8888 &
curl http://localhost:8888/apis/v1beta1/healthz
curl http://localhost:8888/apis/v2beta1/pipelines?page_size=1

# Check UI logs
kubectl logs -n kubeflow -l app=ml-pipeline-ui --tail=20
```

## Status: ✅ MOSTLY RESOLVED
API server is working correctly. UI connectivity issues appear to be startup timing related.
